## Orientation-Preserving Vectorized Distance Between Curves

Here is the Python codes (both in .py and .ipynb) for my joint paper with Jeff Phillips entitled "Orientation-Preserving Vectorized Distance Between Curves". The .ipynb formats can be run easily on google colab or Jupyter Notebook. 

We remark that since there are some randomness in algorithms or train-test split, the results in Table 1 of the paper can differ slightly.

## Datasets

The Car-Bus dataset, namely GPS Trajectories Data Set, is available for public in .csv format in the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/GPS+Trajectories.

The Character Trajectory Data Set is also available for public in .mat format in the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Trajectories.

The pigeons flight path dataset is available for public as supplementary material of a paper published in The Royal Society Publishing: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0885.
