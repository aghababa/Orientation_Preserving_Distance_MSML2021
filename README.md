## Orientation-Preserving Vectorized Distance Between Curves

Here is the Python codes (both in .py and .ipynb) for my joint paper with Jeff Phillips entitled "Orientation-Preserving Vectorized Distance Between Curves". The ipynb format can be run easily on google colab. 

For running some of codes you will need the "Car and Bus dataset" which is available in csv format in this repository inside the folder named Data.

Note that since there are some randomness in algorithms or train/test split, the results in Table 1 of the paper can differ slightly.
